# TouchMIDI
Touchscreen MIDI Controller for Arduino Teensy

This project is an active work in progress:

April 2020
- add SPACE to text editor
- add touch to text editor
- and switch ID to physically controlled buttons
- centre text label over control

March 2019
- preset saving now works. Need to fix the SAVE icon and speed up the SD writing. It's SLOW!

January 2019
- currently working on the Preset Editor. Preset navigation works and the preset control screen permits touch control to select which knob/switch to modify.
